IMPORTANT: The TinyMCE 4.x version of this plugin is under heavy development (and man is it buggy... and messy). Questions, feedback and contributions are welcome!


The TTS Plugin for TinyMCE is a web based text-to-speech editor that visually formats text with pitch, rate, volume, emphasis, and breaks. Itâ€™s able to export basic SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) accepted by text-to-speech engines such as Cepstral voices, and accepted by web services like Voice Forge.

NOTE: This plugin does not generate audio or communicate directly with text-to-speech engines or services. It simply formats text in a fun visual way and exports SSML that you can figure out what to do with after it leaves the editor.
